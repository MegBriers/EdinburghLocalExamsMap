Just a quick bit of R code was used to make this HTML page that displays the number of Junior candidates entered for each of the examination centres in the Edinburgh Local Examinations from 1866-1871. The data is publically avaliable at https://archive.org/details/localexaminatio00univgoog/page/n50/mode/2up and the project was completed as part of a research assistanship in Mathematics.
